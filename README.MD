# Maya's Maya'to Bot

This is just a sandbox toy atm.

Written using the [discord.js library.](https://discord.js.org/)

# Features

Is a discord bot.

Deploys commands, unintuitively.

Deletes all commands known to the bot, semi-intuitively.

Has a collection of functional commands with no practical daily use.

# Notes

This repo includes "public_config.json" containing required(?) global variables. This must be renamed to "config.json" and populated with your own data before running.

This repository does not supply any resources. Thus, you must supply your own. Create a folder "res" in the project root containing the following needed resources:

1. profile-picture.png (A profile picture for the bot that complies with discord's requirements. The file type can be modified, just update your config.json file accordingly.)
2. Nothing else at the moment.
